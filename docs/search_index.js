The project started out as an internal quick-and-dirty set of tools in the Utz research laboratory at the University of Southampton. At the time, Julia was in a very early stage, and its use was experimental. In the meantime, a sizeable number of research projects have been carried out in the group using early versions of NMR.jl, and it seemed like a good idea to complete the tools and the documentation, and make the package available to the community.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Overview","title":"Overview","text":"note: Applications\nNMR.jl is intended to be applicable to any kind of NMR data, and aims at implementing a broad set of features to enable even advanced NMR data processing. Some of its functionality is designed for convenience, making everyday tasks  accessible with a reasonable default set of parameters. Power users may want to use the more low-level routines, which are underlying the high-level interface.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Manual-Outline","page":"Overview","title":"Manual Outline","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Overview","title":"Overview","text":"If you would like to jump right in, read the Getting started section.
